Multitude - A Multilingual NLP System 

üìå Project Overview
Multitude is a multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to perform complete regional news analysis and question answering across diverse languages.
By integrating multiple layers of NLP processing ‚Äì from basic word-level analysis to advanced discourse understanding ‚Äì it provides deep insights into news content and enables intuitive Q&A capabilities for users.

üöÄ Features & Modules

Module 1 ‚Äì Introduction to NLP Foundation
Overview of Natural Language Processing concepts.
Fundamentals of text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, stemming, lemmatization).
Handling multilingual datasets and encoding schemes (UTF-8, Unicode).
News dataset acquisition and language identification.

Module 2 ‚Äì Word Level Analysis
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for multiple languages.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying people, places, and organizations in news.
Morphological analysis for understanding word forms.
Frequency distribution and keyword extraction from multilingual news sources.

Module 3 ‚Äì Syntax Analysis
Parsing sentences to determine grammatical structure.
Dependency parsing for relationship extraction between words.
Chunking and phrase structure detection for better syntactic representation.

Module 4 ‚Äì Semantic Analysis
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for accurate meaning detection.
Semantic role labeling to identify agent, action, and target in news sentences.
Sentiment analysis and emotion detection across regional languages.
Topic modeling for thematic categorization of news articles.

Module 5 ‚Äì Pragmatic & Discourse Processing
Context-aware analysis to interpret meaning beyond literal words.
Coreference resolution for entity tracking across sentences.
Discourse relation detection (cause-effect, contrast, elaboration).
Multi-document summarization for condensed news reporting.

Module 6 ‚Äì Applications Integration
Regional News Analysis Dashboard for real-time monitoring of multilingual news.
Question Answering System using context-driven NLP models.
Integration with APIs for live news feeds and user queries.
Support for voice-based input and output in multiple languages.
